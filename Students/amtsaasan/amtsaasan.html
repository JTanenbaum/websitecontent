									<h3>proSTEM identity development in playful learning contexts</h3>
									<p>
			            My current three-year study uses ethnographic methods including participant observation and open-ended interviews to examine the lived practices of facilitators of pro-science, engineering, technology and mathematics (STEM) identity development in playful learning contexts.
                    If you are at least 18 years old, are a previous or current program or project facilitator within a playful learning environment, and are interested in participating in this study I would love to hear from you. Please contact me at tsaasan@uci.edu.
