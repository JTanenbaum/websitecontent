									My vision is to transform video game experience from screen to physical world, using Augmented Reality, Tangible, Wearable, Ubiquitous Computing, so that the physical reality we live in can be programmed, augmented, and gamified for lots of new experiences and applications.

									<h3>Current Work</h3>
									<p>
									I build proof-of-concept systems and conduct user experience study. Currently, I am working on 1. A WitchCraft game in which players become witches by wearing costumes, walking along a magic circle around a cauldron, and saying incantations to cast spells. 2. A cloud-based storytelling system that realizes the concepts of memory-materialization and object-ensoulment. 3. A review of computer enhanced board games. I am always happy to talk with people with common interest and seek possible cooperation. My email: kjing1@uci.edu; my portfolio website: https://jingke.allyou.net/
